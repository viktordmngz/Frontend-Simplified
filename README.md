# Frontend-Simplified HTML Crash Course
This is the repository where I will upload all of my HTML code from my first lesson. The code I learned is strictly HTML and does not contain any styling via CSS or JS. I added a few extra elements to my HTML that were not covered in the videos. I also tried to keep the layout of the directories the same as what I used while following the lesson.
